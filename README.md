# Credit Card Validator
The Credit Card Validator is a C program designed to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn's algorithm. This console-based application allows users to input credit card numbers and determines whether they are valid according to the algorithm.

# Features
* Luhn's Algorithm: The program employs the Luhn's algorithm, which is a widely used checksum formula to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers.

* Card Type Identification: The validator identifies and classifies credit card types, including American Express (AMEX), MasterCard, and Visa, based on their number patterns and length.

* User-Friendly Interface: The program provides a clear and straightforward command-line interface that prompts users to input credit card numbers. It then provides instant feedback on the validity of the card and its type.
